BlindOS is an Operating Environment System designed specifically for the blind:
the goals of this project is to make a multi-platform system(Windows, Mac, or Linux) 
that is easy to use for blind people that have little to no experience with using computers,
and also to enable advanced computer programming for blind people.

This project also has a second focus which is making itself reprogrammable by blind people,
and allowing to make new applications for it by blind people 
Projects: (in order of importance)
BlindOE (the operation environment, similar to bash) -this program helps people manage their 
files and start programs
line_edutor.lua (offers an easy line editor, the reason for a line editor is so that the whole 
document does not need to be synthesized into speech just to correct one mistake, this tool can be used for programming too.
Programming for the blind.  have a way to edit programs, so that blind people can make new programs, and publish them to the package manager, so that the project can grow more)

edit settings.lua to adjust to  your own OS
requires espeak, please install espeak.
requires lua, please install lua.
then clone this repo.
then tun ./BlindOE.lua

â€”up to here most things have been implemented
To do:
0). BlindIRC (An IRC chat client that allows to simultaneously type while listening to what the chat is saying)
1). modify all / to a variable so it can run fine on windows too
2). BlindWEB (A web client that accesses a group of webpages designed  specifically for the blind), this will also allow people to host their own applications made for BlindOS on the web 
3). Blind Mail Client
4). Blind Music Player
5). Blind App Downloader(package manager)
6). Blind Menu (a kind of desktop for those who prefer to use a menu rather than commands, works kind of like a menu on the telephone)

Other applications for the blind are welcome and will be added to BlindOS
