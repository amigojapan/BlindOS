BlindOS is an Operating Environment System designed specifically for the blind:
the goals of this project are:
-to make a multi-platform system(Windows, Mac, or Linux) that is easy to use for blind people to use their computers withought needing to learn brile
-to enable computer programming for blind people.
-This project also has a second focus which is making itself reprogrammable by blind people, and allowing to make new applications for it by blind people 

Programs: (in order of importance)
 BlindOE (the operation environment, similar to bash) 
 -this program helps people manage their files and start programs
 
 -line_edutor.lua (offers an easy line editor, the reason for a line editor is so that the whole document does not need to be synthesized into speech just to correct one mistake, this tool can be used for programming too,simple version could just have a shortcut for repeating the previous line, and a way to retype it. 

 -voice internet relay chat
